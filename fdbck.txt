Can we develop an interactive calendar that would count down the days until the end of term (this would provide a visual reference for low ability students in helping them to contextualise when they are going home - we are a residential college). As days pass it would be helpful to cross them out, perhaps using a red cross through the day.....?

Please can you add a feature to open a link in a new window?

For example, when clicking the image link below if, opens in the same window

Not sure if I need to link it to something else or not. I am trying to get it done today as I have no students in if you can let me know either by e-mail or by phone 01913754047

Would it be possible to have the "Deadline" component resizeable, so multiple components could fit on a reasonably sized stage.

Thanks.

Fri, 22 Feb 13 11:04:59 +0000 -- Steven -- Bravens@outlook.com -- Hi Frank,

I have been trying to make my widgat today and found a couple of issues, im hoping you can help me

the first is that I have put in the rough design of my widgat, then when i try to put values into the deadline counter the value dropdown will not scroll

the second (this may just be me missing something) is when I have input all my test into the textboxes then start doing the timers all my text disappers, do I need to save or something to stop this happening?

Also, even though I have referenced the image like the other images below it doesn't display the image.

I was also hoping it would be possible to center the calender as I can't do at the moment.

I need also a component box at the bottom of the paging screen where the user when clicking on the symbol it will display in the box at the bottom of the screen.

I also need the option to add a sound to the images which will say what the symbol is when clicked. Is it possible for me to upload my own voice and then the symbols to act as buttons so when they are pressed they are placed in the box at the bottom of the screen and play the sound.

Is this possible?

Hi frank,

above is my widg@t url for you to look at,

I would like the option of removing the text display from the deadline calculator and is there a way to allow the calculator to dynamically update its values if possible?

also the scroll on the deadline attributes will not let you scroll, steve has seen this and may explane better

many thanks
Steven
