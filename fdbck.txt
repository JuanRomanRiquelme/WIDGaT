Can we develop an interactive calendar that would count down the days until the end of term (this would provide a visual reference for low ability students in helping them to contextualise when they are going home - we are a residential college). As days pass it would be helpful to cross them out, perhaps using a red cross through the day.....?

Please can you add a feature to open a link in a new window?

For example, when clicking the image link below if, opens in the same window

Not sure if I need to link it to something else or not. I am trying to get it done today as I have no students in if you can let me know either by e-mail or by phone 01913754047

Would it be possible to have the "Deadline" component resizeable, so multiple components could fit on a reasonably sized stage.

Thanks.

Fri, 22 Feb 13 11:04:59 +0000 -- Steven -- Bravens@outlook.com -- Hi Frank,

I have been trying to make my widgat today and found a couple of issues, im hoping you can help me

the first is that I have put in the rough design of my widgat, then when i try to put values into the deadline counter the value dropdown will not scroll

the second (this may just be me missing something) is when I have input all my test into the textboxes then start doing the timers all my text disappers, do I need to save or something to stop this happening?
