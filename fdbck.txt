Can we develop an interactive calendar that would count down the days until the end of term (this would provide a visual reference for low ability students in helping them to contextualise when they are going home - we are a residential college). As days pass it would be helpful to cross them out, perhaps using a red cross through the day.....?

Please can you add a feature to open a link in a new window?

For example, when clicking the image link below if, opens in the same window
