Can we develop an interactive calendar that would count down the days until the end of term (this would provide a visual reference for low ability students in helping them to contextualise when they are going home - we are a residential college). As days pass it would be helpful to cross them out, perhaps using a red cross through the day.....?

Please can you add a feature to open a link in a new window?

For example, when clicking the image link below if, opens in the same window

Not sure if I need to link it to something else or not. I am trying to get it done today as I have no students in if you can let me know either by e-mail or by phone 01913754047
